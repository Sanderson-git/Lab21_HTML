	<h2>Blogging</h2>
	<p>My blogging consists of movie reviews, specifically the SciFi genre.</p>
	<p>I'm currently watching the Star Trek series. I started with The Next Generation series as I'm not a big fan of William Shatner. I think Patrick Stewart is a phenomenal actor and his role in TNG was a perfect fit. I believe the series still holds great quality even compared to the new age SciFi of today. I've finished watching Star Trek Voyager, and am currently watching the Star Trek Deep Space Nine series.</p>

	<h2>Developing</h2>
	<p>I'm currently enrolled in the Grand Circus coding program based out of Detroit, MI. I've learned a ton about the Java language and now we're currently learning some HTML to utilize Java during web development.

	<h2>Hometown</h2>
	<p>My hometown is Sterling Heights Michigan. My parents moved here when I was about 4 years old and have lived in the same house ever since. I attended Stevenson High School right across the street from Dodge Park. </p>
